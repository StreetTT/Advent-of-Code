# Advent of Code

Here are all my solutions for the **Advent of Code** challenges. Each year's challenges are organized into separate folders. The repository includes starter files, inputs, and solutions for specific days.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Advent-of-Code.git
   cd Advent-of-Code
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create an `.env` file to manage environment variables if required.
   ```env
    # Example .env file
    AoC_token=your_api_key_here
    ```
   

3. **Run Solutions**:
   Navigate to the desired year's directory and run Python scripts for the challenges:
   ```bash
   python 2024/1A.py
   ```

4. **Customize Starter File**:
   Use `starterFile.py` as a base for new challenge solutions.
